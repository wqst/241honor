1. Several clients can connect to the server at the same time(Done)
2. Still alive after server sends the data(DoneS) 
3. Communicate between server and client. Make response.(Doing now)

next step:
1. implement insert, update, add, show features.
2. Broadcast the things to all.

next next:
1. Multiple nodes contact to each other.

11/13:
1. Have 4 servers and they can communicate with each other.(Done)
2. Create a channel for servers communication and have delay in the channel. (Done)
3. Four threads each servernode(server, client, queue thread and handle the message from the queue)

next step:
1. Build a key-value system, including insert, update, delete and show etc.
2. Build the central server to boradcast and update all the things.
3. First implement linearlizbility and sequential consistency.
4. Make response to all the request

11/20:
1. Finish the key-value system
2. Make response to the command

next step:
1. Build the central server and broadcast
2. implement linearlizability and sequential consistency
